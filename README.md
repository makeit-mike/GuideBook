# GuideBook
This is a template to create a "Best Practices" document, that exists on a webserver for better viewing and search-ability


This should be an editable, learnable experience on C#. This also should be able to be reused in a multitude of ways.

As of writing this, all conventions (Naming, Coding, Layout, ...) are each their own Razor Component. 
This has increased speed, but there could be faster ways of retrieving this data.

I recommend cd'ing to your directory and using your terminal of choice to run:
    dotnet watch run 
this will reload the app everytime a change is made. Way better than manually restaring in Visual Studio.


Primarily this application backbones on Highlight.js, and Blazor (razor) components, and is built on the Blazore WebAssembly framework.
